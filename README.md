# ClockSuite

In collaboration with Angelo Lao and Anshuman Banka, this repository hosts the code that ran the Clock Suite. Housed in a small cardboard box, the project is a 24-hour adjustable clock that is displayed through a character LCD screen, along with an LED binary counter. Additionally, there are two other modes of operation: a stopwatch and timer, displayed in a similar fashion to the global clock. The clock is able to concurrently run all three modes without losing accuraccy, through the use of delays on the Arduino MEGA.

Unfortunately, although the project has since been disassembled with the finished project demo never filmed, one of the later tests were filmed and runs through many of the core functions of the project. The video can be found here: https://streamable.com/98c4s
